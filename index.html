        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>This dashboard pulls hourly data for the past 4 years for 3000 coordinates across the city. That is effectively one coordinate for every 2 square kilometers and more than 80 million records.</strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How I got the Idea:</strong> Every time I visit my hometown Mumbai, I can feel & see the air being worse than the last time. Some say it's because of ongoing construction projects, some say it's increased traffic in the city. It is possibly a combination of many such factors. The first step in identifying key factors is to find trends and patterns, and then figure out the underlying cause. That's the idea of the project.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> Data is ingested from a public API source: Open Weather Map. I picked 3000 coordinates all over the city and pulled hourly air quality data for the past 4 years using a python script, before uploading it into an Azure Blob.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> I took the data in my Azure Blob and processed it in Azure Data Factory, configured the data according to my database model, and loaded more than 80 million records into a SQL database.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Factory, SQL Database, Power BI, GitHub Pages</p>

        <p>Air quality in Mumbai has worsened in recent years, and it is imperative to understand the reasons behind this. This dashboard provides insights for the <strong>last 4 years</strong> enabling users to study patterns of pollution cycles and analyze the areas affected.</p>
